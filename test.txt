Coherence is more commonly referred to as the flow of your writing. When a paragraph flows, the reader will
be able to understand the main idea that you have presented. How can you ensure that your paragraph maintains a flow? Well, after presenting your main idea in your topic sentence, each sentence following must build
upon each other in an organized manner. After writing your paragraph, go back and read aloud what you have
written to make sure your ideas are clearly presented. If they are, you have developed a coherent paragraph!
